Aim
Learn how computer virus works and create a new virus with the knowledge obtained through research.

Timeline
week 2-3: Learn about the nature of existing computer viruses. Such as their purpose, spreading and implementation methods.
week 4-7: Implement the virus.
week 8: Compare it against other viruses. Create a report.

Marking Criteria
Weekly blog post to demonstrate what has been achieved. 50%

    The blog post could be either the knowledge or the work log of code.
    The content of each week should reflect efforts of 3 hours.
    The nature of week 2-3 blog post should consists of observation and analysis.
    The nature of week 4-7 should elaborate what has been achieved in the code.

The virus code itself should be evaluated on: 25%

    lethality: the impact/damage the virus is capable of dealing
    benefit: what could I gain from victims of this virus
    survivability: how stealth/detectable is the virus
    infectivity: how quickly does the virus spread
	method of evaluation: keep it contained. Setup a isolated environment such as a personal computer or a vm.

The quality of the final report. 25%

    It should summarize all blog posts and work logs
    It should evaluate the virus

FL: poor effort made in completing this project
PS: demonstrate some understanding of how viruses work
CR: demonstrate a good understanding of how viruses are spread, do damages. Attempted to apply the knowledge to create a virus.
DN: create a virus that is capable of damaging the host in a controlled environment
HD: create a virus that could potentially spread on the internet (without actually doing so)
